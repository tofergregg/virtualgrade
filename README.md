# VirtualGrade
Virtual Grading Software  

VirtualGrade is an online, graphical tool we can use to grade paper assignments. Right now, it is still in the _beta_ phase of development, so there may be some bugs. Please let me know if you find any, or if you have suggestions on improvements.  

For more information, please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/tofergregg/virtualgrade/wiki).
